# DScrap

> One Stop Solution for your Scrap Management

DSCRAP is an efficient online platform that revolutionizes waste recycling, scrap pickup, and scrap selling. By streamlining the entire recycling process, we make it incredibly convenient for users. Our platform enables users to schedule hassle-free scrap pickups from their doorstep, ensuring a seamless experience from collection to delivery at our recycling partner's facility.

With the rapid growth of e-commerce and online businesses, establishing a strong online presence is crucial. To achieve this, we have built our platform on a robust foundation, utilizing Bootstrap, ReactJS, and NodeJS. These cutting-edge technologies empower us to create a user-friendly interface that is both visually appealing and easy to navigate.

For users who wish to register as vendors, our system provides a seamless account creation process. Vendors can leverage our extensive database to develop and grow their businesses. By connecting vendors with potential customers, we foster a thriving marketplace that benefits both parties.

Our primary goal is to provide a user-friendly platform that enhances the recycling experience. Through our intuitive website, users can effortlessly schedule pick-up calls at a time and date that suits them best. On the scheduled date, our team of local vendors will visit the user's home and purchase all available scrap (subject to conditions) at a pre-determined rate from our comprehensive rate list.

At DSCRAP, we are committed to making recycling waste a convenient and sustainable practice for everyone. With our online platform, we are bridging the gap between individuals, vendors, and recycling partners, creating a robust ecosystem that drives positive environmental impact.
